# Installation

1. Clone repository

    ```sh
    cd $HOME && mkdir .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles
    git clone --bare git@github.com:tylerbrostrom/dotfiles.git .
    git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME' checkout
    ```

    >The `.dotfiles/` dirname is arbitrary. You can change it, but be sure to add it to `.gitignore`.

2. Install Homebrew, formulae and casks

    ```sh
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    brew tap homebrew/bundle
    brew bundle install --global
    ```

3. Install pnpm, Node.js

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | PNPM_VERSION=7.0.0-rc.8 sh -
    pnpm env use --global lts
    ```

    >TODO: try installing pnpm via brew as soon as pnpm@7 is available

> You're first going to need to install `zsh` and make it your default shell:
>
> ```sh
> sudo apt install zsh
> chsh -s $(which zsh)
> ```
>
> Close this shell, and open a new one.
>
> Enter 'q' to skip the initial setup prompt (the next step will place a `.zshrc` config file in your home directory).

# Management

Use `dot`. `dot` is an alias for `git`. It works regardless of the current directory.

```sh
# use it like youâ€™d use git
dot add -p
dot push

# works with .gitconfig aliases too
dot st
dot ci
```
